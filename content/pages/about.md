# About the Collective

Dystopian Earth formed around the belief that resilient communities can thrive even when systems fail. We operate in the open when possible and underground when necessary.

Our members include hackers, activists, researchers, artists, and storytellers. Together we run public workshops, publish technical breakdowns, and maintain infrastructure that helps communities resist censorship and surveillance.
