# Our Mission

1. **Share knowledge freely.** We document exploits, defensive tactics, and operational playbooks so communities can defend themselves.
2. **Support each other.** Mutual aid keeps the collective going. Members contribute financially, technically, and emotionally.
3. **Challenge the status quo.** Invite codes are granted to those who can solve puzzles and demonstrate an aligned ethos.
